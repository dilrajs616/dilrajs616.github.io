                    <p class="lead my-4">
                        As an intern at <a href="https://khalisfoundation.org/">Khalis Foundation</a>, me and my teammate Simarjot Singh, are assigned with the project of implementing the voice search feature in apps developed by said foundation. These apps include Sikhi To The Max and Sunder Gutka. Our task is to find the best transcript api that will give the most accurate results for Punjabi language.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead my-4">
                        This documentation will explain all the steps that we followed so it would be easier for fellow developers to find the best transcript api and easily implement in their own apps.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Web Kit Speech Recognition</h3>
                    <p class="lead my-4">
                        The most obvious solution that comes to mind is Web Kit Speech Recognition. This is a web speech api. It is very easy to implement. We don't need an api key to use it. It is very fast. It generates accurate results most of the times. And it supports Punjabi language as well. The only problem is that this is browser based. It can easily be used in web applications but to use it in native environment, we have to find some workarounds. Also it is not supported by all browsers. It primarily works in Chrome and some Chromium-based browsers. <a href="https://github.com/dilrajs616/khalis/blob/main/jsnode/speechRecog.html">Here</a> is a very simple code that you can use to implement this feature. <br>You can read it's complete documentation <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API">here.</a>

                    <h3>Bhashini AI</h3>
                    <p class="lead my-4">
                        Bhashini AI is official LLM(Large Language Model) for indian languages by Indian Govt. It supports mostly all the indian languages and it provides several services like asr (Automated Speech Recognition), text-to-speech etc. You can see the <a href="https://bhashini.gov.in/services">complete list</a> of services and their supported languages.
